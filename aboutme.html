        <p>I am a friendly nature person who love music and arts.
  I like to travel and explore new places I like capturing most of my important moments because they bring out the best memories in the future when you look back at it.
  I like music and reading new novels. Harry Potter series is my favourite.</p>
    <h1>The Dark Knight(Batman)</h1>
    <p>The Batman is a fantastic film. This movie really explores batman in a very different way.
        The scenes with Bruce without the suit interacting and Alfred were very effective and powerful.
        The action is expertly choreographed, very well shot and confidently directed. 
        This is by far the best looking batman movie.
